            <img src="descarga.jpeg" class="auth-image">
            <p>My name is Fabian Crespo and I am a student at Coral Gables Senior High. This is my first year learning to code and I'm exited to see how better I can get. </p>
            <p>I have many hobbies such as playing the guitar and  wrestling for the Coral Gables SH team too!</p>
            <p>I love wrestling since it helps me forget about everything and just makes me feel like I'm in an entire new place where I get to use my strenght with a purpose just not getting strong for the sake of getting strong. It is also super fun since when you outwrestle somebody it feels great as if you just outsmarted your opponent. </p>
